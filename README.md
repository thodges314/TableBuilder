## TableBuilder ##
TableBuilder is a collection of Microsoft Excel files with Visual Basic macros for generating and analyzing Actuarial Table data.  These were all created in Microsoft Excel 2010, and were originally written to use data retreived from the [TableManager 4.0 plugin](http://www.soa.org/professional-interests/technology/tech-table-manager.aspx).  All projects use initial sample data taken from the [Spring 2008 MLC Tables](http://www.soa.org/Files/Edu/edu-2008-spring-mlc-tables.pdf) published by the Society of Actuaries.
