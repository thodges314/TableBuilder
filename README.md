## TableBuilder ##
TableBuilder is a collection of Microsoft Excel files with Visual Basic macros for generating and analyzing Actuarial Table data.  These were all created in Microsoft Excel 2010, and were originally written to use data retreived from the [TableManager 4.0 plugin](http://www.soa.org/professional-interests/technology/tech-table-manager.aspx).  All projects use initial sample data taken from the [Spring 2008 MLC Tables](http://www.soa.org/Files/Edu/edu-2008-spring-mlc-tables.pdf) published by the Society of Actuaries.
This project contains the following files:

----------
#### Expander.xlsm ####
This file replaces gaps in l<sub>x</sub> data with data automatically generated using uniform, exponential or harmonic assumptions.

#### TableBuilderIV.xlsm ####
This uses a table of ages and q<sub>x</sub> values, and quickly creates a table with the complete set of columns of values used on the actuarial exams.  Version 4 corrects a small error in the <sub>n</sub>E<sub>x</sub> data generating function and sports an improved user interface over version 1 (which is omitted from this repo).

#### TableBuilderV.xlsm ####
